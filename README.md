# Dashboard-Portfolio
Welcome to my dashboard portfolio! Here you will find a collection of the dashboards I've developed to showcase my experience and skills in data analysis and visualization.


Explore the dashboards below to see examples of my work:

 - Sales Dashboard - [Comprehensive Analysis of Retail Store Sales Performance](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNmMxYzM5MzUtNjBjYi00ZTEyLThjZDQtYzM0YmRmZTJhM2EzIiwidCI6ImU4Y2YyNjM5LTFmOTgtNGJiNC1iZDg5LWFiZDE0OTI4OTM3ZiJ9)


 - [The "Soda Brands: Performance Analysis"] dashboard is constructed upon a survey encompassing questions such as "When you think of soda, what brands pop into your head?", "With what frequency do you purchase any of these brands?", "What is the main aspect of the following brands?", "Preference at each moment", "Brand Value", "Would you purchase this brand?", and "At what times of the day do you consume soda?" This dashboard meticulously evaluates the data derived from these questions to offer insights into soda brand performance.

This dashboard provides a holistic understanding of consumer perceptions, preferences, and behaviors related to soda brands. It delves into aspects such as brand recognition, purchase frequency, brand attributes, consumer preferences across different occasions, perceived brand value, purchase intent, and consumption patterns throughout the day.

While it may not include pie charts, it employs various other visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and histograms to present the survey data effectively. These visualizations enable stakeholders to grasp key insights at a glance and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

In essence, the "Soda Brands: Performance Analysis" dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for interpreting survey data and deriving actionable insights to enhance the performance and strategic positioning of soda brands in the market.

 - HR Dashboard - Analysis of human resources data, including turnover rate, absenteeism, and employee engagement.

Technologies Used

The dashboards were developed exclusively using Microsoft Power BI. Power BI is a powerful data visualization tool that allows for the creation of interactive dashboards and connection to various data sources.

I utilized advanced features of Power BI, such as creating measures and metrics using the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) language to perform complex calculations and enhance data analysis.
