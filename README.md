# Dashboard-Portfolio
Welcome to my dashboard portfolio! Here you will find a collection of the dashboards I've developed to showcase my experience and skills in data analysis and visualization.


Explore the dashboards below to see examples of my work:

 - Sales Dashboard - [Comprehensive Analysis of Retail Store Sales Performance](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNmMxYzM5MzUtNjBjYi00ZTEyLThjZDQtYzM0YmRmZTJhM2EzIiwidCI6ImU4Y2YyNjM5LTFmOTgtNGJiNC1iZDg5LWFiZDE0OTI4OTM3ZiJ9)

 - Marketing Dashboard - Monitoring of marketing campaign ROI and customer segmentation analysis.
 - HR Dashboard - Analysis of human resources data, including turnover rate, absenteeism, and employee engagement.

Technologies Used

The dashboards were developed exclusively using Microsoft Power BI. Power BI is a powerful data visualization tool that allows for the creation of interactive dashboards and connection to various data sources.

I utilized advanced features of Power BI, such as creating measures and metrics using the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) language to perform complex calculations and enhance data analysis.
